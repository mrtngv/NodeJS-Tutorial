*Package.json is responsible for holding all of the metadata for the project -- name of the project, version number, etc.*

1. We are going to use The `Node Package Manager - NPM`.
2. Type in the console `npm init` and follow the settings.
3. After confirming the final setting, the package.json is going to pop up.
